 - Analyze: allow moving back and forward through move history
 - Play: long polling bug!
   If I create a game in one tab, then join it in another, the other tab stays
   blank for a long time.  I think this happens because the first tab is long-
   polling for the game state, while the second one does a regular request
   (without If-None-Match header). However, the browser will block the second
    request, too!
    To fix: add ?poll=1 to URL to enable long-polling?
      -> this doesn't seem to fix it!

Maybe:
 - Play: show move history/allow viewing previous states.
 - Play: allow undoing/resuming from arbitrary position
   (requires changes to the player protocol to support arbitrary states)
 - General: add standard code to encode/decode window.location.hash,
   then make stateString and stateId named parameters:
     analyze.html#stateString=blabla
     play.html#stateId=blabla
   (maybe not necessary, if we never need more than one parameter.)
 - support Undo in Analyze & Play mode?

Note: if I want to develop the web frontend further, I should probably
redesign/refactor the existing code so it doesn't rely on global variables.
