 - should have some standard code to encode/decode window.location.hash;
   then make stateString and stateId named parameters:
     analyze.html#stateString=blabla
     play.html#stateId=blabla
   (maybe not necessary, if we never need more than one parameter.)
 - show move history? (allow viewing past state without being able to move?)
 - support Undo in Analyze & Play mode?

Note: if I want to develop this further, I should probably redesign/refactor
the existing code so it doesn't rely on global variables.
