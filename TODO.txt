 - should have some standard code to encode/decode window.location.hash
 - show move history?
 - analyze mode: create game from state string (allow playing, and maybe undo?)
 - create new game & play interactively (allow undo?)

Note: if I want to develop this further, I should probably redesign/refactor
the existing code so it doesn't rely on global variables.
